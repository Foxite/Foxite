My name is Dirk, and I'm a freelance backend programmer specializing in C#. My portfolio website is available at https://dirkkok.nl, where you can find a slightly outdated, curated display of my past works. Below you can take an in-depth look at my open-source works. These programs and libraries are free and will always be free.

If you are in need of my services, feel free to contact me at [the@dirkkok.nl](mailto@dirkkok.nl).

When I'm not programming, I enjoy playing Factorio, Runescape, and Among Us.
